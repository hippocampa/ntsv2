Computers felt magical to me back then, and they still do. They offer possibilities I never imagined could exist.
That first encounter holds a special place in my heart and eventually led me to pursue computer science, both as a career and as something I genuinely enjoy in my free time.">

  <h1>About</h1>

  

  <p>Hi. My name is I Gede Teguh Satya Dharma. I live on a small island called Bali.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to computers by my father when I was in kindergarten. It was a simple, old machine with a tube monitor, and people were still using diskettes for external storage.</p>
<p>Computers felt magical to me back then, and they still do. They offer possibilities I never imagined could exist.</p>
<p>That first encounter holds a special place in my heart and eventually led me to pursue computer science, both as a career and as something I genuinely enjoy in my free time.</p>
<p>Computer science is a vast field. Since 2017, I’ve been dedicating myself to explore it further, especially in the areas of data science, machine learning, and deep learning. Though, from time to time, I wander into things beyond that scope.</p>
<p>I live by the words of Richard P. Feynman:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I cannot build, I do not understand.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s part of why this static site exists. I believe that understanding <em>why</em> things work and <em>how</em> they’re built truly matters.</p>
