Hi. My name is I Gede Teguh Satya Dharma. I live on a small island called Bali.

I was first introduced to computers by my father when I was in kindergarten. It was a simple, old machine with a tube monitor, and people were still using diskettes for external storage.

Computers felt magical to me back then, and they still do. They offer possibilities I never imagined could exist.

That first encounter holds a special place in my heart and eventually led me to pursue computer science, both as a career and as something I genuinely enjoy in my free time.

Computer science is a vast field. Since 2017, I’ve been dedicating myself to explore it further, especially in the areas of data science, machine learning, and deep learning. Though, from time to time, I wander into things beyond that scope.

I live by the words of Richard P. Feynman:

> What I cannot build, I do not understand.

That’s part of why this static site exists. I believe that understanding _why_ things work and _how_ they’re built truly matters.
