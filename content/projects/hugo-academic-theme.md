## Overview

A minimalistic, fast-loading academic theme for Hugo static site generator. Designed specifically for researchers, academics, and technical professionals who need a clean, professional web presence.

## Features

- **Minimalistic Design**: Clean, distraction-free layout focusing on content
- **Academic Focus**: Built-in support for publications, projects, and research notes
- **Math Support**: Full $\LaTeX$ support using KaTeX for mathematical notation
- **Fast Loading**: Optimized for performance with minimal JavaScript
- **SEO Friendly**: Comprehensive meta tags and structured data
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design that works on all devices

## Technical Implementation

The theme is built using Hugo's powerful templating system. Key components include:

### Template Structure

```go
{{ define "main" }}
<div class="publications-list">
  {{ range .Pages.ByParam "year" "desc" }}
  <article class="publication-item">
    <h2><a href="{{ .RelPermalink }}">{{ .Title }}</a></h2>
    <div class="meta">
      {{ delimit .Params.authors ", " " and " }} â€¢ {{ .Params.year }}
    </div>
  </article>
  {{ end }}
</div>
{{ end }}
```

### CSS Architecture

The CSS follows a mobile-first approach with semantic class names:

```css
.publication-item {
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ecf0f1;
  padding: 1.5rem 0;
}

.publication-title {
  font-size: 1.25rem;
  font-weight: 600;
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
}
```

## Mathematical Notation Support

The theme includes comprehensive support for mathematical notation. For example, the Gaussian distribution:

$$f(x|\mu,\sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$

Inline math is also supported: $E = mc^2$.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourhandle/hugo-academic-theme
```

2. Add to your Hugo site:
```bash
cd your-hugo-site

```

3. Update your `hugo.toml`:

```

## Configuration

The theme supports extensive customization through Hugo's configuration system:

```toml
[params]
  description = "Your site description"
  author = "Your Name"
  
[menus]
  [[menus.main]]
    name = "Publications"
    url = "/publications"
    weight = 20
```

## Future Development

- [ ] Advanced search functionality
- [ ] PDF generation for publications
- [ ] Integration with academic databases
