## Project Overview

This is a demonstration project created to showcase the load more functionality for the projects section on the homepage. This project serves as the 3rd project entry, which will trigger the "[load more]" button to appear.

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: Demonstrates modern web interaction patterns
- **Minimal Design**: Maintains the raw HTML aesthetic
- **Performance**: Lightweight JavaScript implementation
- **Accessibility**: Works without JavaScript as a fallback

## Technical Implementation

The load more functionality uses vanilla JavaScript:

```javascript
// Simple toggle mechanism
function setupLoadMore(sectionName) {
    const loadMoreBtn = document.getElementById(sectionName + '-load-more');
    const items = document.querySelectorAll('.' + sectionName.replace('s', '') + '-item');
    
    if (loadMoreBtn && items.length > 3) {
        // Toggle visibility logic here
    }
}
```

## Mathematics in Projects

Even project documentation can benefit from mathematical notation:

The complexity of the load more algorithm: $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of items.

Performance metrics: $$\text{Load Time} = \frac{\text{Total Items}}{\text{Render Speed}} + \text{Constant Overhead}$$

## Installation

This is a demo project, but if it were real:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/example/demo-project
cd demo-project
npm install
npm start
```

## Live Demo

Navigate to the homepage to see this project listed under the "projects" section with the interactive load more functionality.
