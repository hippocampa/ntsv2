# Mathematical Notation Test

This is a test of inline math: $E = mc^2$

And here's a display equation:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

The quadratic formula:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

Some inline math in a sentence: The function $f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1$ is a perfect square.
